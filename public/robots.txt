# robots.txt
#
# This file is processed by web crawlers to create indexes for search sites
# like Google, Bing, etc. The Disallow statements in this file prevent web
# crawlers from going down into intermediate search pages while leaving open
# /catalog/, /music/ and /video/ so that direct matches of items listed in
# the sitemap file will be accessible directly.
#
# See http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots.html for documentation on how to
# use the robots.txt file.
#
# NOTE: Entries with non-standard robots.txt syntax ("Allow" entries and
# "Disallow" entries with "*" in the path) only work with Googlebot.
#
# 2015/07/28 - Opened up assets because the Google algorithm now uses them.
