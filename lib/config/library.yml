# lib/config/library.yml
#
# These are all the libraries that Solr currently reports plus the libraries
# that Sirsi reports via Firehose.
#
# Ideally, this information should be generated from a Solr request at startup.
#
# Each entry has the following parts:
#
# name:       The name of the library as it appears in Solr results;
#               if *~* or missing then it is a library that appears in Sirsi
#               but not in the Solr library facet.
#
# short_name: A designation for the library for use in lists where character
#               count is limited; if *~* or missing then this is the same as
#               the value for :name.
#
# full_name:  For use in formal displays where the official name of the library
#               should be displayed (possibly in conjunction with the school);
#               if *~* or missing then this is the same as the value for :name
#               or :short_name (if :name is *~* or missing).
#
# ils_code:   The library code as reported by Sirsi via Firehose; if *~* or
#               missing then the entry is associated with a library that
#               appears in the Solr library facet but is not one of the
#               libraries that appear in the Sirsi ILS.
#
# ils_name:   The library name as reported by Sirsi via Firehose; if *~* or
#               missing then the entry is associated with a library that
#               appears in the Solr library facet but is not one of the
#               libraries that appear in the Sirsi ILS.
#
# school:     The UVA entity responsible for the library; if *~* or missing
#               then it is not a UVA library.
#
# on_site:    Materials can be used on-site at the library.
#
# checkouts:  Materials can be checked out (either in person or through LEO).
#
# on_grounds: Materials are located within the main UVA campus.
#
# The entries for which 'on_site', 'checkouts' and 'on_grounds' are all *true*
# would basically encompass all of what a patron would normally think of as
# UVA library materials.
